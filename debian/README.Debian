How to switch between the various BLAS/LAPACK implementations
=============================================================

- BLAS:

 $ sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3-<multiarch>

- LAPACK:

 $ sudo update-alternatives --config liblapack.so.3-<multiarch>

where <multiarch> is the multiarch path for you architecture (e.g.
x86_64-linux-gnu for amd64).

Building an optimized OpenBLAS package for your machine
=======================================================

On amd64, arm64, i386, ppc64el, s390x, kfreebsd-amd64 and kfreebsd-i386,
libopenblas-base provides a multiple architecture library. All kernels are
included in the library and the one matching best your processor is selected at
run time. Recompiling locally should bring minimal performance improvement.

On the contrary, on other architectures, the package is compiled with minimal
optimizations, so that it can run on all hardware. You may want to recompile it
locally for optimal performance.

If you want to create a custom OpenBLAS package, optimized for your specific
machine, proceed as follows.

1) Install the build dependencies and the source of the package:

 $ sudo apt-get build-dep openblas
 $ apt-get source openblas

2) Compile the package:

 $ cd openblas-<UPSTREAM_VERSION>
 $ DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=custom dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b

where <UPSTREAM_VERSION> is replaced with the appropriate value.

3) When the build finishes, it should produce a .deb file, whose precise name
you can figure out using:

 $ ls ../libopenblas-base_*.deb

Install it using:

 $ sudo dpkg -i ../libopenblas-base_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb

replacing <VERSION> and <ARCH> with the appropriate values.

4) If you don't want the Debian package manager to overwrite your optimized
package with a generic one on system upgrades, you can mark the OpenBLAS
package to be on hold, with the following command:

 $ sudo aptitude hold libopenblas-base

Don't forget however to periodically check whether a more recent version of the
package is available for the Debian suite that you are tracking, in which case
you should go again through this procedure. The version check can be performed
using:

 $ aptitude versions libopenblas-base
